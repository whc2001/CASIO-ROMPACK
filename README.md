# SPECIAL THANKS TO [RA226](https://ra226.net/casio-rom-emulator-ro-226/)'S HARD WORK

# CASIO-ROMPACK

This repo contains something I modified and made for dumping and emulating CASIO's ROMPACK.

## CasioROMdump_Modded

A modified version of Ra226's CasioROMdump. It now automatically stops when the tail bytes are found or not found after 24KB.
